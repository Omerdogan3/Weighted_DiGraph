# Weighted_DiGraph
Adjacency list representation of a weighted directed graph in C++.
Pretty standard implementation but it was written pretty well if I
do say so myself. Has been checked for memory leaks with Valgrind. 
Also includes my implementation of Dijskstra's single source shortest
path algorithm, performing in O(ElogV) time. The Graph implementation is
displayed through the loop in test.cpp.
